      Hello, readers, and welcome to my Composition Portfolio!
      This e-Portfolio serves to document my experience with the First-Year
    Writing program in 2025.
  </p>

  <!-- would like more space on the page here -->

  <p>
      The title of my ENC 1101 Portfolio is yet to be thought up.
    However, the title of my ENC 1102 research project
      will be "<i>Hackers are Writers</i>."
    For the time being, at least.
  </p>

  <h3 id="home-subheader">A Passage about Writing</h3>

    <b>
    <!--
        what I would like to do here is bold and increase the
      size of the first sentence, maybe even change the font!
  
        then keep the next sentences the same size, all within one paragraph. 
    -->  
      To say Composition I was immensely rewarding in how it enabled me
    to tap into a subject that I enjoy so much would be saying little.
    </b>  
      Prior to it, my proudest piece of writing had been
    my college admissions essay, as you will hear about in later portfolio pieces.
      But as I come out the other end, I feel equally proud of each Major Assignment.
  </p>
  <p>  
      I have to give credit to Professor Marks for
    structuring the course in such a simple, yet excellently effective manner.
      Every assignment worked up to this website in a way that I only know now.
      I have deeply appreciated the chance to diversify, <i>and incorporate</i>,
    my learning from the technology classes of my degree to this one.
  </p>
  <p>
      My abilities to write and craft stories have expanded their horizons so greatly
    that I barely even know how to articulate it.
      I hope this Portfolio, and the comparisons that can be made between its contents,
    may speak to such growth in itself.
  </p>
