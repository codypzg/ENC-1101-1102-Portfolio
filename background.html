      <b>Cody Perez-Gilbert is currently a second-year Information Technology
    student at the University of Central Florida.</b>
      He chose to write the code for, and design this website as a way to put
    his skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) to the test.
      Cody has been editing HTML/CSS/JS templates for over 5 years to put
    websites on the Internet, but this project would be his first time
    creating one from the bottom-up.

  <h3 id="header3">Process Works</h3>
  <p>
      Process Works are weekly discussion posts, each with a different prompt.
  </p>
  <p>    
      "These assignments help you toward your major assignments and may consist of
    interacting and communicating with fellow students through online Discussion Forums hosted through Webcourses.

      You will be required to compose postings in response to prompts
    (including planning and drafting for major assignments),
      as well [as] reply to the posts of fellow students."

    (Rachel Marks, "Fall 2025 ENC 1102 M141", UCF Simple Syllabus)
  </p>

  <h3 id="header3">Peer Review</h3>
  <p>
      "You will be required to conduct a Peer Review for every Major Assignment.

    During this time your instructor will pair you with other students in class
      and provide direction for conducting peer review that will be mutually beneficial for all students."

    (Rachel Marks, "Fall 2025 ENC 1102 M141", UCF Simple Syllabus)

  <!--
      I haven't 100% decided yet if I want the actual assignment titles ("Research Proposal") in the subheaders.
  Like, should I save that for each individual webpage? Or does it contextualize the syllabus?
  -->
  <h3 id="header3">Major Assignment 1: Research Proposal</h3>
  <p>
      "In an initial investigation into their research site,
    students will propose methods of primary research for investigating how writing and genre is used by their discourse community
      and create a plan for completing their research.

    Students will receive peer-feedback on their first draft of this assignment before turning in their revised drafts."
      (Rachel Marks, "Fall 2025 ENC 1102 M141", UCF Simple Syllabus)
  </p>

  <h3 id="header3">Major Assignment 2: Annotated Bibliography with CARS Model</h3>
  <p>
      "Students will annotate 4 primary sources from their research site and at least 5 secondary sources
    (3 must be scholarly sources found through library research, 2 may be found in course texts).

      Students will also craft an initial CARS Model introduction
    which will synthesize their sources and contextualize their annotations.

      Students will receive peer-feedback on their first draft of this assignment befroe turning in their revised drafts."
    (Rachel Marks, "Fall 2025 ENC 1102 M141", UCF Simple Syllabus)
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="header3">Major Assignment 3: Academic Research Paper</h3>
  <p>
      "Students will use the secondary and primary data that they have collected throughout the semester to craft a researched argument.

    A complete paper will include an introduction that utilizes the CARS Model,
      including (1) a literature review that synthesizes secondary research,
   (2) will make a claim based on their research findings,
      (3) will describe their methods for primary data,
    (4) will provide a detailed data analysis which provides insight into their claim,
      and (5) conclude by discussing the implications of their research."

    Students will receive peer-feedback on their first draft of this assignment befroe turning in their revised drafts."
      (Rachel Marks, "Fall 2025 ENC 1102 M141", UCF Simple Syllabus)
  </p>

  <h3 id="header3">Major Assignment 4: e-Portfolio</h3>
  <p>
      "ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 use ePortfolios to demonstrate student learning over the course of the semester.
    ePortfolios encourage you to reflect on the course learning outcomes and your knowledge and understanding of writing.

      You'll create a website (e.g., an ePortfolio) that showcases your writing
    and demonstrates how you've engaged with each student learning outcome in this course.
      You should provide evidence of your knowledge about writing and how language works.
    This involves both descriptive and reflective writing.

      ePortfolios are multimodal, so you should think about
    how a website provides opportunities for you to use various modes to communicate effectively
      (e.g., images, videos, audio, text).
      
    ePortfolios should show
  (1) <i>what</i> kinds of learning and writing occurred during the semester,
    (2) <i>how</i> those activities were meaningful to your understanding of writing, rhetoric, language, and literacy,
  and (3) <i>why</i> this knowledge is important for future writing situations."
